Telling Stories with Data (CMU) Public Portfolio - Laura Sayre

# About me
Hi! I'm Laura, and I am a second-year ISPM (InfoSec Policy & Management) student at CMU. I studied Mathematics with a theoretical concentration as an undergraduate student, and I spent 2 years teaching high school math and English classes at a small international school in Mexico City before starting at CMU.

I am currently contributing to data protection and identity & access management (IAM) efforts within my company's Information Risk Management organization.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to be able to represent data effectively and creatively, so that data visualizations supplement presented information rather than distract from it. Once I graduate, I am planning on becoming an Information Security Analyst, so creating beautiful data visualizations would be a beneficial skill for me to adequately convey cyber-related data.
