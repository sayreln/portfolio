# Critique by Design: U.K. Defense Exports (2015-2016)
*This visualization progression focuses on a graphic released by the U.K. Department for International Trade Defence & Security Organisation (DIT DSO) within its year-end statistics report of 2016. The process of analysis and redesign is documented below, with an initial critique of the original visualization, a wireframe for creating a new visualization with the same dataset, and a solution visualization.*

## Original Visualization

The original visualization presented above was included in the DIT DSO's [U.K. Defence & Security Export Statistics for 2016](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/631343/UK_defence_and_security_export_statistics_2016_Final_Version.pdf). It aims to convey the percentage of U.K. defense assets imported by each region in 2016, compared to respective percentages the year before.

I chose to analyze this visualization for various reasons. Upon first looking at this graphic, I noticed the bright colors and general lack of quality. I was taken aback by this, especially considering the entity meant to benefit from this visualization: the U.K. government. Since this data was presented in the DIT DSO's annual statistics report, it is clear that it is intended for other U.K. government departments to reference or analyze for future implementations concerning defense assets. Given this audience, the bright colors (which have no clear correlation to the regions they represent) and fuzziness of the image seem to not meet the professional expectations for government-level reports. Additionally, the use of pie charts for this dataset is confusing, and does not sufficiently convey the differences in percentages for each region from 2015 to 2016. In my  critique of the visualization, I grew interested in generating a new and improved visualization to attempt to convey the same information, but in a more interpretable, engaging, and aesthetically-pleasing way. Referring to Stephen Few's "Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile," I gained insight specifically regarding the importance of creating the visualization in a way that would make the most sense for its audience - in this case, the U.K. government. In my redesign, I wanted to focus primarily on producing a graphic that government workers could quickly and easily read and interpret, ultimately increasing the chance of their using this visualization for future work/projects.

Based on my analysis of the visualization and some of (what I perceived to be) its deficiencies, my goal was to eliminate any ambiguity or confusion sparked by the DIT DSO’s pie charts, so my suggestions included: using a blue color scale, using a different visualization type (e.g., bar graph, treemap), and changing the title, among others.

## Wireframe Visualization

In my wireframe visualization, I chose to show the data via a treemap chart. I did this to represent each region’s percentage as a part of the whole (i.e., U.K.’s total defense exports in 2015 and 2016). I speculated that comparing the sizes of adjacent rectangles would be a much easier task than comparing slices of a pie chart. I also chose a blue sequential color scheme to represent the regions’ percentages, since blue is a neutral and professional color not necessarily associated with any domain. The highest percentages gained the darkest blue color designation, and the lowest percentages gained the lightest blue color designation. Regions with shifting rankings in percentages from 2015 to 2016 maintained the same color for easy comparison. I changed the title to “Percentage of U.K. Defense Exports Imported by Region, 2015-2016."

I gathered feedback from two people regarding my updated visualization. The questions I asked and feedback I received follow: 
* “Can you tell me what you think this is and what it is telling you?” – “U.K. defense exports sent to each region,” “the percentage of U.K. defense exports imported by each region in 2015 and 2016”
* “Is there anything that you find surprising or confusing?” – “the shifting order of the regions from 2015 to 2016 is confusing,” “it’s hard to compare the percentages from 2015 to 2016 since the blocks aren’t proportional”
* “Who do you think the intended audience is?” – “the U.K.,” “other countries’ governments”
* “Is there anything you would change or do differently?” – “I think a bar graph would show a better comparison,” “make the years bigger”

In light of the input I received on my wireframe visualization, I noticed some trends in my visualization that were still not conveying the data with the most clarity. I learned that the treemap - while helpful in showing how each region compared to the whole - was not the best chart to use in comparing percentages from 2015 to 2016. Most of the feedback I received pointed towards the confusion generated when comparing two side-by-side treemap charts.

## Solution Visualization

My redesign focused on utilizing a new visualization type to better show the comparison of the percentages of U.K. defense assets imported by each region from 2015 to 2016. Ultimately, I decided to show this comparison through a stacked bar chart. Each bar represents 100% of the U.K. defense exports in either 2015 or 2016, and the sections comprising each bar represent the regions' percentages of assets imported that year. I used the same color scheme in my solution visualization as I did in my wireframe visualization, with dark blue representing the region with the highest percentage, and light blue representing the region with the lowest percentage. I also changed the title to be more specific to what the data actually shows, so I focused on the Middle East's ranking as the region importing a majority of the U.K.'s defense assets in both 2015 and 2016.
