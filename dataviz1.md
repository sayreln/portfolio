## Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio Year-to-Year (1995-2020)
This chart shows the debt-to-GDP ratios of various countries each year from 1995 until 2020, highlighting the three countries with the highest ratios in 2020 (i.e., Japan, Greece, Italy). The OECD average and total debt-to-GDP ratios are dark gray for contrast against the other countries and comparison for Japan, Greece, and Italy.

## Comparing Visualizations
Clearly, there are various acceptable methods to visualize the "General government debt" dataset published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, depending on what information is being highlighted. To represent the debt-to-GDP ratio for countries in a given year (2019, in the case of the topmost chart), bar charts present audiences information in a clear format, ordering the countries from those with the smallest ratio, to those with the largest (as displayed in the OECD-generated chart). On the other hand, a grid of line charts effectively displays each country's respective debt-to-GDP ratios over the span of multiple years. This methods allows audiences to view each separate country's ratio for many years, whereas the bar chart focuses on one year in particular for many countries. However, it is also helpful to view the countries' ratios next to each other on a yearly basis. Visualizing the data with a scatterplot to depict each country's dept-to-GDP ratio for a given year - and seeing the progression from year to year using a time slider - allows viewers to see the timeline of the debt-to-GDP ratio for one country against that of other countries.

I chose to highlight 3 countries in my third visualization. I wanted to show the progression of the debt-to-GDP ratio for the countries with the highest ratios in 2020 (1. Japan, 2. Greece, 3. Italy), compared to those of the other countries. To do this, I chose colors representative of those countries based on their respective flag colors. I used a lighter shade of gray for every other country and a darker shade of gray for the OECD total and average debt-to-GDP ratios, to provide contrast for viewers to be able to compare the top three countries to the totals and averages. I also used a diamond shape to represent each ratio for each country, because the middle points allow viewers to better read what the corresponding number is for a given ratio. Additionally, I displayed each country's 3-letter ISO code on its respective "diamond," to allow better readability as the timeline progresses.
