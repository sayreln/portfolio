# Final Project - Part 3
## Summary of Work
In Part 1 of the final project, I focused on brainstorming my topic, which included providing a high-level summary, creating an outline of the main elements, identifying my data source, and sketching rough visualizations for my target dataset. I also identified Shorthand as my medium for creating my final product. In Part 2, I created a storyboard that featured wireframes of the visualizations I created for my final project. I also conducted interviews with friends and colleagues to gain feedback on my visualizations and storyboard and determine whether I was properly targetting my audience. I recorded any feedback and key findings and projected any modifications I anticipated making based on the feedback I received.

## Audience
In Part 2 of the final project, I proposed demonstrating my story through 5 parts, or "courses," as it were. Based on the feedback I received from interviewees, I maintained the same target audience as the one I proposed in Part II: the general public. Since a vast majority of people who I spoke with had never dined at a Michelin restaurant before (nor had known that the Michelin brand had associations beyond tires), I determined that continuing with my approach of targetting a variety of people from daily interactions was an ideal method to share the background of Michelin restaurants and encourage people to make a reservation at a Michelin restaurant. Ultimately, Michelin restaurants are not limited to fine-dining experiences and classic French cuisine, and I believe that there is a Michelin for every personality and food preference!

## Part 3 Decisions and Modifications
However, I did make changes to my visualizations, considering comments from some interviewees who had expressed confusion over the purpose of Michelin restaurants, as well as their distinction from other restaurants. I addressed this by eliminating the fake prices associated with Michelin star rankings. Originally, the people with whom I had spoken had believed that Michelin stars had a correlation to the price of dining at a particular restaurant, based on my "Michelin Stars" menu visualization. Since this is not necessarily the case, I suspended any ambiguity to that end by removing the "price" tags and including Michelin stars instead.

Additionally, I included bolded text to visualize key aspects that I wanted to convey, particularly in the cases of "The Michelin Story", "The Michelin Cuisine", and "The Michelin Price."

I also reordered some sections to better portray my story. During Part 2, I had introduced Michelin prices prior to introducing Michelin cuisines. I chose to switch this order for my final project because the price - which is the low/discouraging point of the story - leads into the invitation to make a reservation, since I discussed the cheaper Michelin options.

For my Michelin price visualization, I decided to show the range of minimum and maximum prices for Michelins within the US with a violin plot. I also overlayed a boxplot on top of each violin plot to draw attention to the average and outlying values. For Part 2, I had merely showed the average minimum and maximum prices in contrast to each other, but I determined that showing all price points distributed amongst each other would best convince my audience to make a reservation at a Michelin restaurant, since the average prices were between $120 and $185.

I made considerable changes to my last visualization. Since feedback I received noted the difficulty in discerning between all US Michelin restaurants due to the dots on the map overlapping, I reduced the opacity of the dots. I also created filters to make the map interactive; namely, I used a filter for the "Region" field, so that people could see only the Michelin restaurants in any given region in the US and the map would snap to that area. Additionally, I included hyperlinks to each restaurant's webpage and reservation site within the tooltip function of Tableau, and I displayed the minimum and maximum price for each restaurant within the tooltip function. To make my call to action clear, I provided text to supplement my final visualization, explicitly inviting my audience to make a reservation. Furthermore, I used the minimum price of each restaurant as the determinant for the size of its point on the map. Both the number of Michelin stars and the minimum price point size are included within the legend of my map.

Finally, I ensured that I used the correct hex color code for the Michelin red color throughout my final data story to maintain consistency. I decided to include pictures of Michelin courses as well, and I used the font types in Shorthand to inform my typography decisions in my visualizations, also to maintain consistency.
